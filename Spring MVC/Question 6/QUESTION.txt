6) Example on Validation-API
Develop a spring mvc application based on following guidelines.
a. Design a class Customer with following attributes: username, password, email,
contact, city and zip code.
b. Design a registration.jsp page by using spring form tags.
 Apply the following server-side validations to the above registration form:
• Username should not be empty or null. Username should be alphanumeric and
between 8 to 20 characters. Username should not contain space.
• Password should not be empty or null. Password should contain at least one uppercase letter, lower-case letter, a digit or special character (_, $, #, ., @). Password should
also be 8 to 20 characters long.
 • Email should not be empty or null. Email should be valid.
 • City should be selected.
 • ZipCode should not be empty or null. It should be 6-digits.
If user does not enter valid inputs, error messages should be shown on the registration form
after the input field.
